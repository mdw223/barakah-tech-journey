# About Barakah Tech Journey

## What is Barakah?

**Barakah** (بركة) is an Arabic word that translates to "blessing" or "divine abundance." But it's so much more than material prosperity. Barakah represents a spiritual richness that permeates our work, relationships, and daily lives. It's the quality that makes little feel like much, transforms ordinary efforts into lasting impact, and brings contentment that no salary can buy.

When we have barakah in our work, our efforts multiply in ways we never imagined. Time feels more productive, challenges become opportunities for growth, and our contributions ripple outward to benefit our communities in meaningful ways.

## The Crisis of Purpose in Tech

Today's job market has left many young professionals in tech feeling desperate—willing to work anywhere, for anyone, doing anything, just to get that first role or next opportunity. I've felt this pressure myself. The tech industry's materialistic culture constantly pushes us to chase higher salaries, prestigious titles, and impressive company names, often at the expense of our core values and principles.

We're told to optimize our resumes, game the interview process, and maximize our compensation packages. But somewhere in this race, many of us lose sight of a fundamental question: *What are we actually building, and who are we building it for?*

## My Choice: Purpose Over Prestige

Currently, I'm a Computer Science senior at NC State University with a 3.71 GPA, and I work as a Full-Stack Software Engineer at Axiom Software—a startup you've probably never heard of. When I had the opportunity to join Axiom, I made a deliberate choice that went against conventional wisdom in tech recruiting.

I chose to work for a startup that has a clear vision: **to help build and invest in the Muslim community**. While others were chasing FAANG offers and unicorn startups, I found something more valuable—a company that aligns with my values and contributes to the growth and empowerment of my community.

At Axiom, I'm not just building features; I'm creating tools that help organizations serve our community better. Whether it's developing CRM integrations, building email campaign systems, or implementing prospect management dashboards, every line of code serves a higher purpose.

## Three Pillars of Barakah in Work

Through my journey, I've learned that seeking barakah in our careers requires commitment to three fundamental principles:

### 1. Positively Impact Your Community
Our work should serve something greater than ourselves. Whether we're building software, teaching, or serving in any capacity, we should ask: *How does this benefit the people around me? How does this strengthen my community?* 

Technology has immense power to uplift communities, but only when we intentionally direct it toward that purpose.

### 2. Never Compromise Your Values
The pressure to compromise is real. The job market will tempt you to work on projects that contradict your principles, to accept cultures that erode your character, or to chase opportunities that enrich your bank account while impoverishing your soul.

Seeking barakah means drawing clear lines and having the courage to say no—even when it's difficult, even when others don't understand.

### 3. Strive for Excellence (Ihsan)
**Ihsan** (إحسان) means excellence, perfection, and doing beautiful work—as if you're being watched by the Divine. It's the principle of giving your absolute best in everything you do, not for recognition or reward, but because excellence itself is an act of worship.

In tech, this means writing clean code, thinking deeply about user experience, mentoring others generously, and approaching every task with integrity and craftsmanship.

## What This Blog Is About

This blog is my attempt to document the journey of seeking barakah while building a career in tech. I'll write about:

- **Technical lessons** from my work at Axiom—the challenges of full-stack development, API integrations, database design, and real-world problem-solving
- **Career reflections** on navigating the tech industry with intentionality and values
- **Community building** and how technology can serve as a tool for positive impact
- **Personal growth** as I learn to balance ambition with contentment, progress with principle

I won't pretend to have all the answers. I'm still early in my journey, still learning, still making mistakes. But I'm committed to pursuing a path that prioritizes meaning over money, purpose over prestige, and barakah over the hollow metrics of success that our industry celebrates.

## Join the Journey

If you're also trying to find barakah in your work—whether in tech or any other field—I hope these reflections resonate with you. Let's build careers that don't just advance our own interests, but elevate our communities and honor our values.

May our work be filled with barakah, and may we find success in both this life and the next.
