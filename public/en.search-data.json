Whether we’re building software, teaching, or serving in any capacity, we should ask: How does this benefit the people around me? How does this strengthen my community?\nTechnology has immense power to uplift communities, but only when we intentionally direct it toward that purpose.","2-never-compromise-your-values#2. Never Compromise Your Values":"The pressure to compromise is real. The job market will tempt you to work on projects that contradict your principles, to accept cultures that erode your character, or to chase opportunities that enrich your bank account while impoverishing your soul.\nSeeking barakah means drawing clear lines and having the courage to say no—even when it’s difficult, even when others don’t understand.","3-strive-for-excellence-ihsan#3. Strive for Excellence (Ihsan)":"Ihsan (إحسان) means excellence, perfection, and doing beautiful work—as if you’re being watched by the Divine. It’s the principle of giving your absolute best in everything you do, not for recognition or reward, but because excellence itself is an act of worship.\nIn tech, this means writing clean code, thinking deeply about user experience, mentoring others generously, and approaching every task with integrity and craftsmanship.","about-barakah-tech-journey#About Barakah Tech Journey":"About Barakah Tech Journey","join-the-journey#Join the Journey":"If you’re also trying to find barakah in your work—whether in tech or any other field—I hope these reflections resonate with you. Let’s build careers that don’t just advance our own interests, but elevate our communities and honor our values.\nMay our work be filled with barakah, and may we find success in both this life and the next.\nMalik Wensman\nComputer Science @ NC State University\nFull-Stack Engineer @ Axiom Software\nLinkedIn | GitHub","my-choice-purpose-over-prestige#My Choice: Purpose Over Prestige":"Currently, I’m a Computer Science senior at NC State University with a 3.71 GPA, and I work as a Full-Stack Software Engineer at Axiom Software—a startup you’ve probably never heard of. When I had the opportunity to join Axiom, I made a deliberate choice that went against conventional wisdom in tech recruiting.\nI chose to work for a startup that has a clear vision: to help build and invest in the Muslim community. While others were chasing FAANG offers and unicorn startups, I found something more valuable—a company that aligns with my values and contributes to the growth and empowerment of my community.\nAt Axiom, I’m not just building features; I’m creating tools that help organizations serve our community better. Whether it’s developing CRM integrations, building email campaign systems, or implementing prospect management dashboards, every line of code serves a higher purpose.","the-crisis-of-purpose-in-tech#The Crisis of Purpose in Tech":"Today’s job market has left many young professionals in tech feeling desperate—willing to work anywhere, for anyone, doing anything, just to get that first role or next opportunity. I’ve felt this pressure myself. The tech industry’s materialistic culture constantly pushes us to chase higher salaries, prestigious titles, and impressive company names, often at the expense of our core values and principles.\nWe’re told to optimize our resumes, game the interview process, and maximize our compensation packages. But somewhere in this race, many of us lose sight of a fundamental question: What are we actually building, and who are we building it for?","three-pillars-of-barakah-in-work#Three Pillars of Barakah in Work":"Through my journey, I’ve learned that seeking barakah in our careers requires commitment to three fundamental principles:","what-is-barakah#What is Barakah?":"Barakah (بركة) is an Arabic word that translates to “blessing” or “divine abundance.” But it’s so much more than material prosperity. Barakah represents a spiritual richness that permeates our work, relationships, and daily lives. It’s the quality that makes little feel like much, transforms ordinary efforts into lasting impact, and brings contentment that no salary can buy.\nWhen we have barakah in our work, our efforts multiply in ways we never imagined. Time feels more productive, challenges become opportunities for growth, and our contributions ripple outward to benefit our communities in meaningful ways.","what-this-blog-is-about#What This Blog Is About":"This blog is my attempt to document the journey of seeking barakah while building a career in tech. I’ll write about:\nTechnical lessons from my work at Axiom—the challenges of full-stack development, API integrations, database design, and real-world problem-solving Career reflections on navigating the tech industry with intentionality and values Community building and how technology can serve as a tool for positive impact Personal growth as I learn to balance ambition with contentment, progress with principle I won’t pretend to have all the answers. I’m still early in my journey, still learning, still making mistakes. But I’m committed to pursuing a path that prioritizes meaning over money, purpose over prestige, and barakah over the hollow metrics of success that our industry celebrates."},"title":"about"},"/barakah-tech-journey/blog/ibm-techxchange-orlando/":{"data":{"1-simple-reflex-agent#1.

Add Agent Component - The core processing unit - Configure agent behavior and settings 3. Add LLM/Model to the Agent - Select your model provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, IBM Watson, etc.) - Enter API key in the component settings - Configure model parameters: * Temperature: Controls randomness * Max tokens: Response length * System prompt: Agent instructions 4. Add Tools to the Agent - Example: arXiv tool * Searches academic papers * Retrieves research information * Returns relevant findings - Other available tools: * Web Search (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo) * Wikipedia * Calculator * Python REPL * Custom API tools 5. Add Chat Output Component - Displays agent responses to users - Configure output formatting 6. Connect the Components - Draw connections between components: Chat Input → Agent → Chat Output Model → Agent Tools → Agent 7.
